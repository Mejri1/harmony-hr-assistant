**Private and Confidential**

Dear \[***Insert Name***\]

Thank you for your letter of resignation dated \[***insert date***\].

We are very sorry that you have decided to resign. I am now writing on behalf of the Company to accept your resignation and to explain what will happen from here.

As you are aware, your contract of employment provides for a \[***insert period of notice required***\] notice period, which means that your final day of employment should be \[***insert date***\]. However, instead of requiring you to work your notice period, the Company has decided to place you on garden leave with effect from \[***insert date***\], in accordance with Clause \[***insert clause number***\] of your contract of employment.

This means you will continue to receive full pay and benefits (apart from benefits that are given to enable you to carry out your role, such as \[***insert benefits, eg laptop, mobile phone***, ***company car***) in the normal manner. You will remain bound by the obligations and restrictions set down in your contract of employment, aside from the duty to attend work. A copy of your employment contract is attached, highlighting the clauses which apply in this regard.

During the garden leave period, you will not be allowed to come to work and must stay away from the workplace. In addition, you are not permitted to take up other employment during this period and must remain available to be contacted by the Company.

You are required to return all Company property to \[***insert name and job title***\] by \[***insert date***\]. You should also ensure that any documents which relate to your work are returned, whether hard copy or on your computer.

Please sign and return the enclosed copy of this letter to \[***insert name and job title***\], confirming your understanding and acceptance of the terms of your garden leave.

Yours sincerely

\[***Insert Name and Job Title***\]

For and on behalf of \[***Hydatis***\]

\[***Insert name and address of recipient***\]

\[I, \[***insert name of employee***\], confirm that I understand and accept the terms of my garden leave as stated in this letter.

Signed:

Name of Employee
