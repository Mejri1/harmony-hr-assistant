    6.  In addition to this Policy, when using the Company's Internet and Communications Facilities, Users must also comply with other Company Policies including the Company's Data Protection Policy, Equal Opportunities and Diversity Policy, and Harassment and Bullying Policy **\[*add other policies if required*\]**.

1.  Use the Company's Internet and Communication Facilities, and non-electronic facilities including but not limited to Company letterheads and stationery, responsibly and professionally and at all times in accordance with their duties;

2.  Be mindful of what constitutes confidential or restricted information and ensure that such information is never disseminated in the course of communications without express authority;

4.  Ensure that they do not breach any copyright or other intellectual property right when making communications;

5.  Ensure that they do not bind themselves or the Company to any agreement without express authority to do so; and

6.  Be mindful of the fact that any communication may be required to be relied upon in court, to the advantage or the detriment of the individual or the Company, and to conduct their use of communication systems and equipment accordingly.

7.  The viewing, transmission, downloading, uploading, or accessing in any way of any of the following material using the Company's Internet and Communications Facilities will amount to gross misconduct with the possibility of summary dismissal:

    1.  Material which is pornographic, sexist, racist, homophobic, or any other discriminatory or otherwise offensive material;

3.  **Internet Use\**

    1.  The Company provides access to the internet for the sole purpose of business and to assist Users in the performance of their duties. **\[**Use of the internet for personal purposes is strictly prohibited.**\]** **OR** **\[**However, the Company recognises that Users may need to use the internet for personal purposes and such use is permitted provided it is reasonable and **\[**does not interfere with the User's performance of their duties**\]** **OR \[**is outside of normal working hours or during a break.**\]\]** Users may be asked to justify the amount of time they have spent on the internet or the sites they have visited.

    2.  Users must not use the internet to gain or attempt to gain unauthorised access to computer material or private databases, including restricted areas of the Company's network. Nor must they intentionally or recklessly introduce any form of malware, spyware, virus, or other malicious software or code to the communications equipment or systems of the Company.

Users should note that even material that is legal under UK law may nonetheless be in sufficiently bad taste to fall within this definition. As a general rule, if any person might be offended by any content, or if that material may be a source of embarrassment to the Company or otherwise tarnish the Company's image, viewing that material will constitute a breach of this Policy. Any such attempt will constitute a disciplinary offence and in addition to internet access being reviewed, reduced, or withdrawn, may be subject to disciplinary action or summary dismissal.

    4.  **\[**Social Media contacts made during the course of business are to be treated as confidential information belonging to the Company.**\]**

    5.  **\[**Before using Social Media on behalf of the Company, Users may require training in order to do so, or may be required to demonstrate that they have already received suitable training, either from the Company or from a previous employer or other organisation.**\]**

    2.  Unless specifically instructed to do so \[***insert name and job title***\], Users should make it clear that they are posting on Social Media as themselves, not as the Company, and that all opinions and ideas expressed on Social Media by that User are those of the User and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Company.

    1.  The email address with which Users are provided by the Company (ending in the suffix \[***\@emailaddress***\]) is provided for business purposes in order to facilitate information sharing and timely communication with \[***insert recipients - customers, clients, colleagues***\]. Any Company business which is conducted via email must be conducted using Company email and is under no circumstances to be conducted through any other personal email address or account.

    2.  Users should adopt the following points as part of best practice:

        1.  Before communicating via email, Users should satisfy themselves that it is the most suitable mode of communication, particularly where time is of the essence;

        2.  Ensure that the email contains the Company disclaimer notice. This should be added automatically by the email client. If it is not, Users should speak to \[***insert name and job title***\] immediately;

        3.  All emails should contain the appropriate business reference(s), either in the subject line or in the body of the text;

        4.  Emails should be worded appropriately and in the same professional manner as if they were a letter;

        5.  Users should be careful not to copy an email automatically to everyone copied in to the original message to which they are responding as this may result in inappropriate or unlawful disclosure of confidential information and/or personal data;

        6.  Users should take care with the content of emails, in particular avoiding incorrect or improper statements and the unauthorised inclusion of confidential information or personal data. Failure to follow this point may lead to claims for discrimination, harassment, defamation, breach of contract, breach of confidentiality, or personal data breaches;

        7.  All emails should be proofread before transmission, which includes ensuring that any attachments referred to in the text are actually attached and are correct and the intended recipients' email addresses are correct;

        8.  If an important document is transmitted via email, the sender should telephone the recipient to confirm that the document has been received in full;

        9.  **\[**All emails received relating to a \[***insert subject titles***\] should be printed and filed in the appropriate place;**\]**

        10. **\[**No email relating to a \[***insert subject titles***\] should be deleted unless a hard copy has first been printed and filed.**\]**

    3.  Users must not email any business document to their own or a colleague's personal web-based email accounts. **\[**Furthermore, Users must not email any business document to any \[***insert recipients - customers, clients, colleagues***\] web-based email address unless specifically permitted to do so by the recipient.**\]**

    4.  **\[**Use of Company email for any personal matter is prohibited as it places additional strain on the Company's communications facilities.**\] *OR*** **\[**Users may use Company email for personal purposes, provided that such use is kept to a minimum and does not interfere with the performance of the User's duties. In any case Users are not permitted to use their Company email address to subscribe to any newsletters or to receive any marketing, as this will result in extra unnecessary burden being placed upon the Company's communications systems. All personal emails should be labelled "personal" in the subject line.**\]**

    5.  **\[**If Users do use Company email for personal reasons, they will be deemed to agree to the possibility that any emails sent or received may be subject to monitoring in accordance with Part 14 of this Policy.**\]**

    6.  Users must not send abusive, obscene, discriminatory, racist, harassing, derogatory, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate material in emails. If any User feels that they have been or are being harassed or bullied, or if they are offended by material received in an email from another User, they should inform \[***insert name and job title***\].

    7.  Users should at all times remember that email messages may have to be disclosed as evidence for any court proceedings or investigations by regulatory bodies and may therefore be prejudicial to both their and the Company's interests. Users should remember that data which appears to have been deleted is often recoverable. If secure deletion is required, for example, where an email contains confidential information or personal data, Users should follow the steps set out in the Company's ***\[insert titles of relevant policies***\].

10. **Personal Email Use**

**\[**Users are permitted to access and use their personal email accounts only to the extent that such use is reasonable and \[does not interfere with the User's performance of their duties**\] OR \[**is outside of normal working hours or during a break**\]**.**\]**

11. **Company Telephone System Use\**

    1.  The Company's telephone lines and mobile phones issued by the Company are for the exclusive use by Users working on the Company's business. Essential personal telephone calls regarding Users' domestic arrangements are acceptable, but excessive use of the Company's telephone system and/or mobile phones for personal calls is prohibited. Acceptable use may be defined as no more than \[***insert amount of time***\] of personal calls in a working day. Any personal telephone calls should be timed to cause minimal disruption to Users' work.

    2.  Users should be aware that telephone calls made and received on the Company's telephone lines **\[**and mobile phones issued by the Company**\]** may be routinely monitored to ensure customer satisfaction or to check the telephone system is not being abused.

Essential personal telephone calls regarding Users' domestic arrangements are acceptable, but excessive use of Users' own mobile phones for personal communications (including, but not limited to, calls, messaging, emailing, and web browsing) is prohibited. In order to avoid disruption to others, mobile phones should be set to silent during normal working hours.

    2.  Any personal telephone calls on Users' own mobile phones should be timed to cause minimal disruption to Users' work and to colleagues working nearby.

13. **Security\**

    1.  The integrity of the Company's business relies on the security of the Company's Internet and Communications Facilities. Users bear the responsibility of preserving the security of Company's Internet and Communications Facilities through careful and cautious use.

    2.  **\[**Access to certain websites and online services via the Company's Internet and Communications Facilities is blocked.

Users must not attempt to circumvent any blocks placed on any website or service by the Company.**\]**

    3.  Users must not download or install any software or program without the express permission of \[***insert name and job title***\] and are reminded of paragraphs 3.2 and 3.5 of this Policy.

Users are reminded that it is good practice to change passwords regularly. **\[**Further guidance on passwords is contained in the Company's ***\[insert titles of relevant policies***\].**\]**

    6.  Users must ensure that confidential information, personal data, and other sensitive information is kept secure. The security of personal data in particular is governed by the Company's Data Protection Policy, which Users must comply with at all times when handling personal data. Workstations and screens should be locked when the User is away from the machine and hard copy files and documents should be secured when not in use.

    7.  If a User has been issued with a laptop, tablet, smartphone, or other mobile device, that device should be kept secure at all times, particularly when travelling. Mobile devices must be password-protected **\[**and, where more secure methods are available, such as fingerprint recognition, such methods must be used**\]**. Confidential information, personal data, and other sensitive information stored and/or accessed on a mobile device should be kept to the minimum necessary for the User to perform their duties. Users should also be aware that when using mobile devices outside of the workplace, information displayed on them may be read by unauthorised third parties, for example, in public places and on public transport.

    8.  **\[**Users using Company-issued mobile devices (as outlined above in paragraph 13.7) must not connect such devices to public wi-fi networks, for example, in cafes, restaurants, and on public transport **\[**without the express approval of a particular network from \[***insert name and job title***\].**\]\]**

    9.  When opening email from external sources Users must exercise caution in light of the risk malware, spyware, viruses, and other malicious software or code pose to system security.

        1.  To ensure Company policies and guidelines are followed, and standards of service are maintained;

By using the Company's Internet and Communications Facilities for personal use, Users are taken to consent to personal communications being logged and monitored by the Company. The Company shall ensure that any monitoring of Users' use of the Company's Internet and Communications Facilities complies with all relevant legislation including, but not limited to, the GDPR (EU Regulation 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation) and the Human Rights Act 1998. **\[**For further information, please refer to the Company's ***\[insert titles of relevant policies***\].**\]**

    3.  When monitoring emails, the Company will normally restrict itself to looking at the address and heading of the emails. However, if it is considered necessary, the Company may open and read emails. Users should be aware that sensitive and confidential communications should not be sent by email because it cannot be guaranteed to be private. Users are reminded that any permitted personal emails should be marked as "personal" in the subject line.

15. **Recruitment**

**\[**The Company may use internet searches to carry out due diligence as part of its recruitment process. In these circumstances, the Company will act in accordance with its equal opportunities and data protection obligations.**\]**
