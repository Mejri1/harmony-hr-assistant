**Employee Data Protection Policy**

***Last updated date:***

1.  **Introduction**

This Policy sets out the obligations of Hydatis, a company registered in \[***insert country of registration***\] under number 123456, whose registered office is at \[***insert Company's Registered Office***\] (the ***Company***) regarding data protection and the rights of its employees (in this context, ***employee data subjects***) in respect of their personal data under EU Regulation 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation (***GDPR***).

The GDPR defines "personal data" as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (a ***data subject***); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

This Policy sets the Company's obligations regarding the collection, processing, transfer, storage, and disposal of personal data relating to employee data subjects. The procedures and principles set out herein must be followed at all times by the Company, its employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company.

The Company is committed not only to the letter of the law, but also to the spirit of the law and places high importance on the correct, lawful, and fair handling of all personal data, respecting the legal rights, privacy, and trust of all individuals with whom it deals.

2.  **The Data Protection Principles**

This Policy aims to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The GDPR sets out the following principles with which any party handling personal data must comply. All personal data must be:

1.  Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.

2.  Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes.

3.  Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed.

4.  Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, is erased, or rectified without delay.

5.  Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed. Personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject.

6.  Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

4.  **Lawful, Fair, and Transparent Data Processing\**

    1.  The GDPR seeks to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. The GDPR states that processing of personal data shall be lawful if at least one of the following applies:

        1.  The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;

        2.  The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract with them;

        3.  The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject;

        4.  The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;

        5.  The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller; or

        6.  The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

    2.  If the personal data in question is ***special category data*** (also known as ***sensitive personal data*** (for example, data concerning the data subject's race, ethnicity, politics, religion, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics (if used for ID purposes), health, sex life, or sexual orientation), at least one of the following conditions must be met:

        1.  The data subject has given their explicit consent to the processing of such data for one or more specified purposes (unless EU or EU Member State law prohibits them from doing so);

        2.  The processing is necessary for the purpose of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the data controller or of the data subject in the field of employment, social security, and social protection law (insofar as it is authorised by EU or EU Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to EU Member State law which provides for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject);

        3.  The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;

        4.  The data controller is a foundation, association, or other non-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious, or trade union aim, and the processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities, provided that the processing relates solely to the members or former members of that body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data is not disclosed outside the body without the consent of the data subjects;

        5.  The processing relates to personal data which is clearly made public by the data subject;

        6.  The processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;

        7.  The processing is necessary for substantial public interest reasons, on the basis of EU or EU Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, shall respect the essence of the right to data protection, and shall provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject;

        8.  The processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of an employee, for medical diagnosis, for the provision of health or social care or treatment, or the management of health or social care systems or services on the basis of EU or EU Member State law or pursuant to a contract with a health professional, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 9(3) of the GDPR;

        9.  The processing is necessary for public interest reasons in the area of public health, for example, protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of EU or EU Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (in particular, professional secrecy); or

        10. The processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) of the GDPR based on EU or EU Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection, and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.

Where an employee data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data based on its legitimate interests, the Company shall cease such processing immediately, unless it can be demonstrated that the Company's legitimate grounds for such processing override the employee data subject's interests, rights, and freedoms, or that the processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims.

    3.  **\[**Where an employee data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data for direct marketing purposes, the Company shall cease such processing immediately.**\]**

    4.  **\[**Where an employee data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data for scientific and/or historical research and statistics purposes, the employee data subject must, under the GDPR, "demonstrate grounds relating to his or her particular situation".

In particular, the Company places a high priority on maintaining health and safety in the workplace, on promoting equal opportunities, and on preventing discrimination on the grounds of disability or other medical conditions. In most cases, health data on employees falls within the GDPR's definition of special category data (see Part 4 of this Policy for a definition). Any and all data relating to employee data subjects' health, therefore, will be collected, held, and processed strictly in accordance with the conditions for processing special category personal data, as set out in Part 4 of this Policy. No special category personal data will be collected, held, or processed without the relevant employee data subject's express consent.

    2.  Health records shall be accessible and used only by \[***insert name, job title and company department***\] and shall not be revealed to other employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company **\[**without the express consent of the employee data subject(s) to whom such data relates**\],** except in exceptional circumstances where the wellbeing of the employee data subject(s) to whom the data relates is at stake and such circumstances satisfy one or more of the conditions set out in Part 4.2 of this Policy.

    3.  Health records will only be collected, held, and processed to the extent required to ensure that employees are able to perform their work correctly, legally, safely, and without unlawful or unfair impediments or discrimination.

    4.  Employee data subjects have the right to request that the Company does not keep health records about them. All such requests must be made in writing and addressed to \[***insert name, job title and contact details***\].

23. **Benefits\**

    1.  In cases where employee data subjects are enrolled in benefit schemes which are provided by the Company, it may be necessary from time to time for third party organisations to collect personal data from relevant employee data subjects.

    2.  Prior to the collection of such data, employee data subjects will be fully informed of the personal data that is to be collected, the reasons for its collection, and the way(s) in which it will be processed, as per the information requirements set out in Part 12 of this Policy.

    3.  The Company shall not use any such personal data except insofar as is necessary in the administration of the relevant benefits schemes.

24. **\[Trade Unions\**

    1.  The Company will provide the following personal data concerning relevant employee data subjects to bona fide trade unions where those unions are recognised by the Company. In most cases, information about an individual's trade union membership falls within the GDPR's definition of special category data (see Part 4 of this Policy for a definition). Any and all data relating to employee data subjects' trade union membership, therefore, will be collected, held, and processed strictly in accordance with the conditions for processing special category personal data, as set out in Part 4 of this Policy. No special category personal data will be collected, held, or processed without the relevant employee data subject's express consent. The following data will be collected and supplied:

        1.  ***Name***;

        2.  Job ***description***;

        3.  \[***insert type of personal data its purpose***\];

        4.  \[***add any further data as necessary***\].

    2.  All employee data subjects have the right to request that the Company does not supply their personal data to trade unions and shall be informed of that right before any such transfer is made.**\]**

25. **Employee Monitoring\**

    1.  The Company may from time to time monitor the activities of employee data subjects. Such monitoring may include, but will not necessarily be limited to, internet and email monitoring. In the event that monitoring of any kind is to take place (unless exceptional circumstances, such as the investigation of criminal activity or a matter of equal severity, justify covert monitoring), employee data subjects will be informed of the exact nature of the monitoring in advance.

    2.  Monitoring should not (unless exceptional circumstances justify it, as above) interfere with an employee's normal duties.

    3.  Monitoring will only take place if the Company considers that it is necessary to achieve the benefit it is intended to achieve. Personal data collected during any such monitoring will only be collected, held, and processed for reasons directly related to (and necessary for) achieving the intended result and, at all times, in accordance with employee data subjects' rights and the Company's obligations under the GDPR.

    4.
