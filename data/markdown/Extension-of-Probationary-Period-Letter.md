We will, of course, continue to monitor your performance and conduct and we will formally review your progress at the end of the extended probationary period as well as providing you with our feedback on an ongoing basis. We must advise you that if you fail to make sufficient progress either during or by the end of your extended probationary period, this is likely to result in your dismissal. You should be aware that we may not be prepared to extend the probationary period again.

We hope that you will work with the Company to improve your performance or conduct so that dismissal will not be necessary.

Yours sincerely,
