**Probationary Period Policy**

***Last updated date:***

# Introduction

It is the Company's policy to operate probationary periods for all new employees and, in some cases, in respect of employees who have been transferred or promoted into different posts.

This policy allows both the employee and his or her line manager to assess whether or not the employee in question is suitable for the role.

Under this Probationary Periods Policy, the employee's line manager has responsibility for ensuring that all new employees are properly managed during their probationary period and their performance is regularly monitored. In particular, the line manager must ensure that the employee is properly informed at the start of his or her employment about what is expected during the probationary period, for example in respect of required standards of performance.

# Length of probation

The Company's standard probationary period is \[***insert probationary period, eg 3 months/6 months***\] in duration.

The Company reserves the right to extend an employee\'s period of probation at its discretion. A probationary period may only be extended once and the total period of probation will be no longer than \[***insert time period***\].

A probationary period may be extended in circumstances where the employee\'s performance during the probationary period has not been entirely satisfactory but it is thought likely that an extension to the probationary period may lead to an improvement. It may also be extended if the employee or his or her line manager has been absent from the workplace for an extended period during probation.

Before a decision is taken to extend an employee\'s probationary period, the employee's line manager must consult with \[***insert Job Title***\]. If an extension to the probationary period is agreed, the employee's line manager must meet with the employee before the end of the probationary period to discuss the following:

1.  the length of the extension to the probationary period and the date on which the extended period of probation will end;

2.  the reason for the extension to the probationary period. If the reason for the extension is the employee's unsatisfactory performance, the line manager will supply details of how and why his or her performance has fallen short of the required standards and any support, e.g. coaching or training, that will be given; and

3.  the performance standards or objectives that the employee is required to achieve by the end of the extended period of probation.

All of the above will be confirmed in writing after the meeting to extend the probationary period. The letter will also include a statement that, if the employee does not meet fully the required standards by the end of the extended period of probation, his or her employment will be terminated.

# Terms of employment during the probationary period

During the probationary period, employees will be subject to the terms and conditions set down in their contracts of employment.

**\[**The amount of notice that an employee must give to the Company if he or she wishes to resign and the amount of notice that the Company must give to the employee in order to terminate his or her employment, are different during the probationary period. Once the probationary period has been completed, the notice periods will be as defined in the employee\'s contract of employment.**\]**

# Reviews during probationary period

The employee's line manager should review and assess the employee\'s performance, capability, and suitability for the role on a \[***insert time period, eg weekly, monthly, quarterly***\] basis during the employee\'s probation, and again at the end of the probationary period. A written record should be made of each review meeting.

In addition to the formal review meetings, the line manager should provide regular feedback to the employee about his/her performance and progress during the probationary period. If any concerns are identified, these should be raised with the employee as soon as possible with a view to resolving them. The line manager is also responsible for providing guidance and support during the probationary period.

# End of the probationary period

Before the end of the probationary period, the line manager should carry out a final review of the employee\'s performance and suitability for the job. This will involve a meeting with the employee to discuss his or her performance and progress throughout the probationary period. If the employee\'s performance is satisfactory, the line manager should advise \[***insert Job Title***\] and ask for a letter to be sent to the employee, confirming him or her in post.

If the employee\'s performance has not met the standards required by the organisation, the line manager should discuss the matter with \[***insert Job Title***\] before deciding on next steps.

If the employee\'s performance during the probationary period has not been entirely satisfactory but it is thought likely that an extension to the probationary period may lead to an improvement, then the probationary period will be extended in accordance with point 2 above. If, however, the employee\'s performance while on probation has been unsatisfactory and it is thought unlikely that further training or support would lead to an improvement, the employee's employment will be terminated at the end of the period of probation (see point 6 below).

# Termination of employment

As a general rule, it is the Company's policy to allow employees to complete the designated probationary period in order to give the employee the best possible opportunity to come up to the required standards. If, however, there is clear evidence before the end of the probationary period to suggest that the employee is wholly unsuitable for the role, the line manager should consult \[***insert Job Title***\] to discuss the early termination of the employee\'s contract.

If the decision is taken to terminate the employee\'s employment, a meeting will be held with the employee and he or she informed of the reason for the termination. Following the meeting, the Company will write to the employee confirming the reason for the termination of the employee's employment and giving him or her an opportunity to appeal against the decision.

If the employee is an existing employee who has been transferred or promoted into a different role, the Company\'s normal capability or dismissal procedure must be followed in full.
