Having carefully reviewed the circumstances, I have decided to issue you with an \[informal/ formal/final written\] warning which will remain on your file for a period of \[insert amount\] months.

We will continue to monitor your attendance and, should there be additional repeated instances, we may instigate further disciplinary action which could result in the issue of a formal/final written warning or, ultimately, your dismissal.
