Dear \[***Insert Name***\]

**Your Appeal**

You appealed against the decision of the disciplinary hearing that you be dismissed on the grounds of \[reason for dismissal\], namely the \[specify grounds for dismissal\]. The appeal hearing was held on date.

I gave careful consideration to the content of your appeal letter, the appeal hearing and all contributory factors. However, I am now writing to confirm that the original decision still stands. I feel that this is the appropriate sanction given the circumstances.

You have now exercised your right of appeal under the Company Disciplinary Procedure and this decision is final.

Yours sincerely
