Dear \[***Insert Name***\]

**Your Flexible Working Request**

I refer to our meeting held on \[insert date\] in which we discussed your request for a change to your pattern of working. As explained to you at the meeting, the working pattern you requested would have been impractical for the organisation to accommodate. However, we discussed possible alternative patterns of working for you and would like to propose the following:

\[Specify proposed change to working pattern\]. \[The total amount of contracted hours you will work each week will remain unchanged\]. These changes will take effect the day following your response, if you are in agreement with the proposal.

Should you accept, these new terms represent a permanent variation to your contract of employment.

Please sign the attached copy of this letter and return it to \[insert name\] to signify your agreement to the changes detailed above. Alternatively, should you be unhappy with the amended terms proposed you may appeal in writing within 14 days of receipt of this letter to \[insert name\]. Your letter requesting an appeal meeting must set out the grounds on which you wish to appeal against the organisation\'s decision as set out above.

Yours sincerely

\[***Insert Name and Job Title***\]

For and on behalf of \[***Hydatis***\]
