Dear \[***Insert Name***\]

**Your Appeal**

You appealed against the decision of the disciplinary hearing that you be given an \[informal/ formal/final written warning\] in accordance with the Company Disciplinary Procedure. The appeal hearing was held on date.

I gave careful consideration to the content of your statement and all contributory factors. However, I am now writing to confirm that the original decision still stands. I feel that this is the appropriate sanction given \[include reason for upholding decision\].

You have now exercised your right of appeal under the Company Disciplinary Procedure and this decision is final.

Yours sincerely
